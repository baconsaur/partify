# Partify

## What does this actually do?
   - Great question! The magic behind the scenes takes an image and applies a Red, Blue, Green, Aplha (RGBA) filter to the image. The RGBA filter is what gives the illusion this image is having a party.

## I love this! Do I need to download anything to get started?
   - Nope! This web application is deployed to heroku. You can get started with Partify by clicking [this link](https://ancient-fjord-96143.herokuapp.com/).

## How can I see this in action?
